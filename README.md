mathCL is baed on Geral Roylance's CLMATH system.
However, some files were missing, so these files have been edited to remove reference to those files.
They have been renamed slightly.
They have been edited to confoorm to the expectatioons of Medley CommonLisp.
They have also been slightly reformatted to enhanced readability.

To load all the files at once, use (load mathload.l)
